# A Simple CRUD App

To get started:
- Open up a mongod instance by typing `mongod` in your terminal
- Open up another terminal tab and type `npm install` to install all of your dependencies
- After all the dependencies have installed you can now run the app. In your terminal type `node app.js`
- Open up a browser to `localhost:3000` and start adding your superheroes!

This app is based on the tutorial by Michael Herman that can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://mherman.org/blog/2015/08/24/node-express-swig-mongo-primer/">here</a>.
